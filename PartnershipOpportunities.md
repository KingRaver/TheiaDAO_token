## Partnership Philosophy

Our approach to partnerships is guided by three core principles:

1. **Ecological Alignment**: All partnerships must contribute positively to our mission of ecosystem restoration.
2. **Mutual Value Creation**: Partnerships should create meaningful value for all participants and stakeholders.
3. **Long-term Relationships**: We focus on sustained collaborations rather than short-term transactions.
