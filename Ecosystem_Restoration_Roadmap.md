## Introduction

This roadmap outlines TheiaDAO's strategic plan for ecosystem restoration through 2030. It identifies priority watersheds, keystone species, restoration methodologies, and timelines for achieving measurable ecological recovery. As a living document, it will evolve through community governance and scientific guidance to reflect emerging opportunities and lessons learned.

### The Challenge We Face

Worldwide, waterways and their associated ecosystems face unprecedented threats:

- 35% of wetlands have disappeared since 1970
- 81% of freshwater species populations have declined significantly
- 65% of river habitats are considered severely modified or degraded
- Hydrological changes affect 48% of river volume globally

Our focus on watershed restoration addresses these challenges by targeting the systems that connect terrestrial and aquatic environments, creating cascading benefits for biodiversity, climate resilience, and human wellbeing.

### Our Vision of Success

By 2030, TheiaDAO aims to:

- Restore 50+ miles of degraded waterways to ecological functionality
- Reestablish viable populations of 25+ locally extirpated species
- Create resilient ecosystems that can adapt to changing climate conditions
- Develop replicable models for community-led ecological regeneration
- Build a new paradigm for funding restoration through regenerative economics

## Restoration Philosophy

TheiaDAO approaches ecosystem restoration with these guiding principles:

### Holistic Systems Approach

We recognize that ecosystems are complex networks of relationships rather than collections of individual species. Our restoration work follows these key principles:

1. **Watershed-based Planning**: Addressing entire hydrological systems rather than isolated segments
2. **Connectivity Focus**: Restoring connections between habitats and ecological processes
3. **Process Over Structure**: Prioritizing ecosystem function over specific configurations
4. **Resilience Building**: Creating systems that can adapt to disturbance and change
5. **Evolutionary Potential**: Allowing for ecological adaptation rather than static preservation

### Integrating Knowledge Systems

Our restoration approach combines:

| Knowledge System | Contribution | Application |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Western Science | Methodology, measurement, experimental design | Monitoring protocols, adaptive management |
| Traditional Ecological Knowledge | Long-term observation, relationship-based management | Species selection, timing of interventions |
| Local Experience | Site-specific insights, historical changes | Identifying reference conditions, feasibility assessment |
| Community Wisdom | Values, priorities, stewardship capacity | Project selection, maintenance planning |

### Ethical Framework

Our restoration work is guided by these ethical principles:

- **Do No Harm**: Interventions should not damage existing ecological values
- **Minimal Intervention**: Using the least intrusive approaches to catalyze natural recovery
- **Appropriate Technology**: Employing tools that match the context and community capacity
- **Transparency**: Open sharing of methods, results, and lessons learned
- **Intergenerational Equity**: Considering impacts on future human and ecological communities
