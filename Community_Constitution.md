## Core Values

### Ecological Integrity

We recognize that healthy ecosystems are the foundation of all life and commit to restoration practices that enhance biodiversity, improve watershed health, and strengthen ecosystem resilience.

### Scientific Rigor

We ground our decisions in the best available science while remaining open to diverse knowledge systems, including traditional ecological knowledge. We commit to evidence-based action and continuous learning.

### Community Empowerment

We believe that lasting ecological change requires engaged communities. We commit to inclusive participation, shared decision-making, and equitable distribution of both responsibilities and benefits.

### Intergenerational Equity

We act as stewards for future generations, making decisions that consider long-term ecological health and the wellbeing of those who will inherit the ecosystems we restore.

### Transparency

We commit to open communication, clear documentation of decisions and outcomes, and accessible information about all aspects of our governance and ecological work.

### Regenerative Economics

We build economic systems that align incentives with ecological health, ensuring that our governance model creates value for both community members and the ecosystems we serve.

## Governance Framework

THEIA governance operates on multiple levels, each with distinct functions and authorities:

### Token-Based Governance

The primary decision-making mechanism occurs through proposals and voting by THEIA token holders:

- **Locked tokens** provide governance rights proportional to the square root of tokens locked (quadratic voting)
- **Minimum thresholds** ensure proposals have sufficient support for consideration
- **Tiered approval requirements** scale with the significance and impact of proposals

### Scientific Oversight

The Scientific Advisory Board, represented by Scientist NFT holders, ensures ecological integrity:

- **Review authority** for all ecological decisions
- **Veto power** over proposals that would compromise ecosystem health
- **Ecological guidance** through research, monitoring, and adaptive management frameworks

### Working Groups

Community-led working groups focus on specific aspects of our mission:

- **Restoration Projects**: Implementing and monitoring ecological initiatives
- **Governance Development**: Refining our decision-making processes
- **Community Engagement**: Building participation and education
- **Treasury Management**: Stewarding community resources
- **Technology Development**: Creating and maintaining our technical infrastructure

### Executive Implementation

Day-to-day operations are managed by designated individuals and teams:

- **Ecological Team**: Leading on-the-ground restoration work
- **Technology Team**: Maintaining governance infrastructure
- **Communications Team**: Facilitating community information flow
- **Administrative Support**: Ensuring organizational functioning

## Decision-Making Processes

THEIA governance follows structured processes to ensure thoughtful, transparent decisions:

### Proposal Types

1. **Ecological Projects**: Initiatives directly focused on restoration
2. **Treasury Allocations**: Funding decisions for various purposes
3. **Governance Updates**: Changes to decision-making structures and processes
4. **Parameter Adjustments**: Modifications to key system variables
5. **Strategic Directions**: Long-term vision and priorities

### Voting Mechanism

- **Quadratic Voting**: Voting power = √(Locked Tokens) × Duration Multiplier
- **Minimum Participation**: Thresholds ensure sufficient community engagement
- **Graduated Thresholds**: Higher-impact decisions require greater consensus
