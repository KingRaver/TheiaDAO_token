## 🌍 Reimagining Ecological Governance

THEIA isn't just another governance token. It's the backbone of a revolutionary system where technology, community, and ecological restoration converge. As the governance layer for TheiaDAO, THEIA empowers holders to direct the future of ecosystem regeneration while aligning incentives across stakeholders.

**Our mission**: Leverage blockchain technology to restore vital waterways and empower the regrowth of keystone species of flora and fauna devastated by monoculture farming and environmental degradation.

## ✨ What Makes THEIA Different?

### 🔒 Locked-by-Design
THEIA tokens can be locked for governance participation, creating a community of committed stewards rather than speculative traders. The token is designed to incentivize long-term thinking and ecological alignment.

### 🌊 Multi-Chain, Like Nature Itself
Just as ecosystems don't recognize artificial boundaries, THEIA operates seamlessly across Polygon, Optimism, and Avalanche, creating a fluid governance system that leverages the strengths of each chain.

### 📈 Quadratic Voting That Amplifies Every Voice
Our governance system uses quadratic voting, ensuring that wealth doesn't equal control. Small holders have meaningful input while still rewarding larger supporters.

### 🔬 Scientific Oversight Through NFT Innovation
The Scientist NFT represents a groundbreaking approach to ecological governance. Real scientists hold soulbound NFTs with veto power to ensure proposals align with proven ecological principles.

### 💧 Revenue Sharing That Grows With Impact
1% of protocol revenue flows directly to locked token holders, creating a sustainable economic model that rewards governance participation. As Vivid Visions grows, so does the value returned to the community.
