### Example: Successful Ecological Proposal

**Title**: Willow Creek Riparian Restoration Project

**Summary**: This proposal seeks to restore 2.5 miles of degraded riparian habitat along Willow Creek through native replanting, stream remeandering, and community monitoring.

**Background**: Willow Creek has experienced 85% loss of riparian vegetation due to agricultural practices, leading to erosion, water quality degradation, and habitat loss for 12 native species.

**Objectives**:
- Reestablish 50-foot native vegetation buffers along 2.5 miles of creek
- Restore natural stream morphology through 5 strategic remeandering interventions
- Reduce water temperature by 4°C during summer months
- Reintroduce 3 locally extirpated riparian plant species

**Ecological Impact**: Expected outcomes include improved water quality, enhanced habitat for 15+ bird species, increased native fish populations, and reduced downstream flooding.

**Implementation Plan**: [Detailed restoration methodology]

**Budget**: 125,000 THEIA tokens allocated as follows:
- 70,000 for restoration materials and equipment
- 40,000 for skilled labor and supervision
- 10,000 for monitoring equipment and reporting
- 5,000 for community training and engagement

**Timeline**: 18-month implementation with quarterly milestones

**Success Metrics**: Water quality parameters, vegetation establishment rates, bird and fish species counts, community participation hours

**Team**: Led by River Restoration Working Group with scientific oversight from Dr. Elena Rivera

### Proposal Submission Requirements

To submit a formal proposal, you must:

1. Hold or have delegation of at least 10,000 locked THEIA tokens
2. Complete the proposal template fully
3. Participate in at least one community discussion about your idea
4. Secure preliminary feedback from at least one Scientific Advisor
5. Commit to leading or supporting the proposal implementation

## Voting with Impact

Your vote is a powerful tool for ecological impact. Understanding how voting works helps you maximize your influence.

### Quadratic Voting Explained

THEIA uses quadratic voting to ensure both broad participation and committed engagement:

**Voting Power = √(Locked Tokens) × Lock Duration Multiplier**

This formula means:
- Everyone's vote matters, regardless of holdings
- Large token holders have more influence, but not proportionally
- Long-term commitment (locking) is rewarded with additional influence

### Voting Power Examples

| Locked Tokens | Lock Duration | Traditional Voting Power | Quadratic Voting Power |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| 1,000,000 | Permanent | 1,000,000 | 2,000 |
| 100,000 | 4 Years | 100,000 | 474 |
| 10,000 | 2 Years | 10,000 | 112 |
| 1,000 | 1 Year | 1,000 | 32 |

*This approach significantly reduces power disparities while still recognizing different levels of commitment.*
