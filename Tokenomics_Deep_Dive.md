## Distribution Strategy

The THEIA token distribution is designed to prioritize community ownership while ensuring sustainable project development.

| Allocation Category | Percentage | Amount | Vesting Period | Notes |
|--------------------|------------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Community & Ecosystem | 40% | 40,000,000 | Various | Powers governance and ecological initiatives |
| Team & Advisors | 15% | 15,000,000 | 3 years with 1-year cliff | Aligns long-term team incentives |
| Treasury | 20% | 20,000,000 | N/A (Governed by DAO) | Supports ongoing development and operations |
| Ecological Partners | 10% | 10,000,000 | 2 years with 6-month cliff | For scientific and conservation partners |
| Initial Funding Round | 10% | 10,000,000 | 18 months linear vesting | For aligned early supporters |
| Liquidity Provision | 5% | 5,000,000 | Locked in AMMs | Ensures market accessibility |

## Value Accrual Mechanisms

THEIA's value accrual is built on several complementary mechanisms:

### 1. Revenue Sharing

1% of all Vivid Visions revenue is distributed to locked THEIA token holders. This creates direct economic value tied to the success of the protocol's operations. The percentage can be adjusted through governance, with scientific oversight ensuring alignment with ecological goals.

### 2. Governance Utility

Locked THEIA tokens provide governance rights using a quadratic voting system. This utility creates demand for tokens from individuals and organizations wanting to influence the direction of the DAO and its ecological initiatives.

### 3. Ecological Impact Credits

Future development roadmap includes integration with carbon and biodiversity credits, creating additional value streams tied to measurable ecological improvements. Token holders will gain priority access to impact credits generated through Canopy Culture initiatives.

## Locking Mechanism & Governance

The THEIA token's locking mechanism is central to its economic model and governance system.

### Locking Options

| Lock Duration | Governance Multiplier | Revenue Share Multiplier | Unlocking Method |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Permanent Lock | 2.0x | 1.5x | Governance vote only |
| 4 Years | 1.5x | 1.25x | Time-based or governance |
| 2 Years | 1.25x | 1.1x | Time-based or governance |
| 1 Year | 1.0x | 1.0x | Time-based or governance |

### Quadratic Voting Formula

Voting power is calculated using a quadratic formula to ensure equitable representation regardless of holding size:

```
Voting Power = √(Locked Tokens) × Duration Multiplier
```

This formula ensures that:
- All token holders have meaningful input
- Large holders still receive appropriate influence
- The community cannot be controlled by a small number of wealthy participants

### Example Voting Power Distribution

| Locked Tokens | Lock Duration | Raw Voting Power | With Quadratic Formula |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 1,000,000 | Permanent | 1,000,000 | 2,000 |
| 100,000 | 4 Years | 100,000 | 474 |
| 10,000 | 2 Years | 10,000 | 112 |
| 1,000 | 1 Year | 1,000 | 32 |

*The quadratic formula significantly reduces the power disparity between large and small token holders.*

## Revenue Sharing Model

The revenue sharing model creates a direct connection between Vivid Visions' success and token holder rewards.

### Current Revenue Allocation

- **1% of all Vivid Visions revenue** is allocated to locked token holders
- Distribution occurs in real-time as revenue is generated
- Rewards are proportional to the amount and duration of locked tokens

### Revenue Projection Model

| Year | Projected Vivid Visions Revenue | THEIA Revenue Share | Estimated APY for Locked Tokens |
|------|----------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Year 1 | $5,000,000 | $50,000 | 0.5% |
| Year 2 | $15,000,000 | $150,000 | 1.5% |
| Year 3 | $40,000,000 | $400,000 | 4.0% |
| Year 4 | $100,000,000 | $1,000,000 | 10.0% |

*These projections are based on conservative growth estimates and may vary.*

### Revenue Sharing Governance

The revenue sharing percentage can be increased through governance with approval from:
1. Majority of locked token holders (weighted by locked amount)
2. Scientific oversight NFT holder(s)

This dual-approval system ensures economic and ecological alignment in any parameter changes.

## Cross-Chain Economics

The multi-chain deployment of THEIA creates unique economic opportunities while ensuring unified governance.

### Cross-Chain Balancing

- Total token supply is consistent across all chains
- Bridge contracts lock tokens on the source chain before minting on the destination chain
- Governance actions are synchronized across all chains
- Users can choose the chain with optimal gas costs for their transactions

### Chain-Specific Incentives

| Chain | Key Benefits | Focus Area |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Polygon | Low transaction fees | Day-to-day governance |
| Optimism | Ethereum security with lower fees | Long-term governance decisions |
| Avalanche | High transaction throughput | Revenue distribution and frequent updates |

## Economic Alignment with Ecological Goals

THEIA's tokenomics are designed to ensure economic incentives directly support ecological restoration.

### Alignment Mechanisms

1. **Scientific Oversight NFT**: Economic parameter changes require approval from ecological experts
2. **Impact Metrics Integration**: Future development will tie token value to measurable ecological improvements
3. **Sunset Reviews**: Regular governance reviews ensure the token remains aligned with restoration goals
4. **Revenue Source**: Value accrues from Vivid Visions, which directly funds Canopy Culture initiatives

### Case Study: Waterway Restoration Economics

| Restoration Phase | Economic Requirements | Token Holder Benefit | Ecological Impact |
|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Research & Planning | 500,000 THEIA | Governance participation | Baseline establishment |
| Initial Restoration | 2,000,000 THEIA | Revenue share increase of 0.1% | Water quality improvement +15% |
| Monitoring & Maintenance | 1,000,000 THEIA annually | Priority impact credit access | Biodiversity index increase +25% |
| Scale & Replication | 5,000,000 THEIA | Ecosystem partner benefits | Carbon sequestration +10,000 tons |

## Simulations & Projections

### Token Value Drivers

1. **Utility Value**: Governance participation and influence
2. **Economic Value**: Revenue sharing and potential appreciation
3. **Impact Value**: Connection to real-world ecological improvements
4. **Network Value**: Growing ecosystem of partners and initiatives

### 5-Year Token Economics Simulation

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| % of Supply Locked | 25% | 45% | 60% |
| Avg Lock Duration | 1.2 years | 2.5 years | 3.5 years |
| Active Governance Participants | 2,500 | 10,000 | 25,000 |
| Ecological Projects Funded | 3 | 15 | 40 |
| Annual Revenue Share to Token Holders | $50,000 | $500,000 | $2,500,000 |

## Risk Factors & Mitigations

| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Governance Attacks | Attempts to capture governance through token acquisition | Quadratic voting + scientific oversight |
| Regulatory Changes | Evolving token regulations in various jurisdictions | Legal compliance framework + multi-chain approach |
| Market Volatility | Price fluctuations affecting governance stability | Focus on locked tokens + revenue share |
| Economic Misalignment | Economic incentives diverging from ecological goals | Scientific oversight + regular sunset reviews |
| Bridge Security | Risks associated with cross-chain bridges | Audited contracts + phased implementation |
